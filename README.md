# 💾 Automated File Backup Script
This Python script automatically creates a daily backup of a folder by copying it into a destination directory. Each backup is stored in a subfolder named with the current date.

## ✨ Features
- Automatically copies files from a source folder to a backup folder

📅 Creates a new subfolder named after today’s date (YYYY-MM-DD)

⏰ Runs every day at a scheduled time using the schedule module

🔄 Can overwrite/update backups if needed (Python 3.8+)

⚡ Requirements

🐍 Python 3.8 or later

📦 Install required library:

pip install schedule


📁 A Backup folder must already exist at the destination path you set in:

destination_dir = "C:/Users/HP/OneDrive/Desktop/Backup"

🚀 Usage

🔧 Clone or download this script.

✏️ Update the following paths in the script:

source_dir = "C:/Users/HP/OneDrive/Desktop/Wallpapers"
destination_dir = "C:/Users/HP/OneDrive/Desktop/Backup"


⚠️ Make sure the Backup folder already exists at the destination path.

▶️ Run the script:

python automated_backup.py


⏳ The script will run continuously and perform the backup every day at 18:55.

⚙️ Customization

🕒 Change schedule time:

schedule.every().day.at("18:55").do(lambda: copy_folder_to_directory(source_dir, destination_dir))


🔄 Overwrite existing backups (default with dirs_exist_ok=True).

📂 Keep separate backups per day (e.g., Backup/2025-09-25).

📂 Example Output

If today is 2025-09-25, after running the script your backup directory will look like:

Backup/
 ├── 2025-09-24/
 ├── 2025-09-25/

💡 Notes

🖥️ To make it run automatically without keeping the terminal open:

⚙️ Use Windows Task Scheduler (recommended).

📦 Or convert to .exe with PyInstaller
