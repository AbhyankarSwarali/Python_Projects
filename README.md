# 🎨 Colour Code
A simple Mastermind-inspired code-breaking game built with Python. The goal is to guess the secret sequence of colours within a limited number of tries.

## 📌 How It Works
- The program randomly generates a code consisting of 4 colours from:
> R, G, Y, B, W, O
- R = Red
- G = Green
- Y = Yellow
- B = Blue
- W = White
- O = Orange

- You have 10 tries to guess the code.
- For each guess, the program provides feedback:
- **Correct positions** → Number of colours in the right position.

🎯 Incorrect positions → Number of correct colours but in the wrong position.

If you guess all 4 colours in the correct order, you win 🎉.

If you run out of tries, the correct code is revealed.

🖊️ Example Gameplay
Welcome to Colour Code
You have 10 to guess the correct code...
You must guess among: R G Y B W O

Guess: R G Y B
Correct positions: 1
Incorrect positions: 2

Guess: R W O G
Correct positions: 0
Incorrect positions: 3

Guess: R B Y O
You guessed the code in 3 tries.
