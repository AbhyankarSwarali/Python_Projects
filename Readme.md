# 🎲 Dice Rolling Game
A fun and interactive Python-based dice rolling game for 2–4 players, where the first player to reach 50 points wins. The game adds a twist — rolling a 1 ends your turn and gives you zero points for that round!

## 📜 Game Rules
**Number of Players**: Choose between 2 to 4 players.

**Objective**: Be the first player to score 50 or more points.

**Gameplay**:

* On your turn, choose whether to roll the dice.

* If you roll any number from 2–6, the value is added to your round score.

* You can stop rolling anytime to secure your current round score.

**Winning**: The game continues until a player reaches 50 points or more.
